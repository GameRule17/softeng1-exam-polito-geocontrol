# Timesheet

Report in this table the effort (in person hours) spent per week, per activity, per team.
[One person hour is the effort of one person working one hour.S
Two person hours is the effort of one person working 2 hours, or 2 persons working one hour. And so on.]
You have to sum the working hours of each component of the team.
Count only effort spent on GeoControl (so do not count effort spent in virtual labs, studying, lessons)

These figures will not be used to evaluate neither the project nor the team, they are meant as practical application of basic project management.

**NOTES**
- During the week of April 21-27, the team was waiting for the official requirements to be published before starting the coding phase.
- Higher effort was spent for testing than coding, to reach all possible scenarios and boundaries.
