# Informal description

GeoControl is a software system designed for monitoring physical and environmental variables in various contexts: from hydrogeological analyses of mountain areas to the surveillance of historical buildings, and even the control of internal parameters (such as temperature or lighting) in residential or working environments.

# Business Model

GeoControl has been commissioned by the Union of Mountain Communities of the Piedmont Region, it will generate its primary revenue through this institutional partnership, reflecting the strategic importance of regional hydrogeological monitoring. At the same time, the platform can expand its reach by being commercialized to other public and private organizations that require high-frequency and reliable environmental data collection with customized licensing agreements.

# System Design

# System Design - GeoControl

## Description

The **GeoControl System**, initially represented as a black box in the Context Diagram, is now described in terms of its internal components, highlighting how it interacts with various external actors in a structured and coherent way.

**External Actors** (as defined in the Context Diagram):  
1. **System Admin**: manages users and network configurations.  
2. **Operator**: handles the management of sensors and gateways.  
3. **Viewer**: accesses reports, statistics, and measurements through visualization interfaces.  
4. **Sensor(s) and Gateway(s)**: send environmental data to the system.

### Inside the Black Box – Modular Architecture:

1. **Auth/API**: handles authentication, authorization, and secure access to system functionalities. It interfaces directly with the System Admin and provides REST endpoints for Operators and Viewers.

2. **Web GUI / RESTful Services**: exposes functionalities via web interfaces and REST APIs for users and operators. It serves as the entry point for all human interactions with the system.

3. **Logic**: contains the core application logic: request processing, device management, and data flow handling.  
   It works closely with the Statistics Engine for processing measured data.

4. **Statistics Engine**: calculates indicators, aggregations, and performs analysis on data collected from sensors.  
   Provides results to the Viewer through the GUI.

5. **Repository**: manages access and persistence of logical entities and metadata (e.g., configurations, users).  
   Communicates directly with the Logic module.

6. **Measurement Storage**: stores and organizes measurements received from gateways.  
   Interfaces with both the Statistics Engine and the Logic module for historical analysis and visualization.

### Interaction with the Physical Environment:

1. **Gateway(s)**: receive data from Sensor(s) through physical channels (e.g., Serial/USB), convert it, and send it to the system.

2. **Sensor(s)**: perform periodic measurements (every 10 minutes) and transmit data to the Gateway.
